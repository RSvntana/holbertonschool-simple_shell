SYNOPSIS
simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell command is a minimalist UNIX shell that provides a basic command line interface.

Displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. Each command line ends with a newline character.
The prompt is displayed again after each command execution.
Commands are simple; no semicolons, pipes, redirections, or advanced features.
Commands are made of only one word; no arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed, and the prompt is displayed again.
Handles errors and the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
